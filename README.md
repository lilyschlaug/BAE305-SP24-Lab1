Laboratory 1 Knowing your Instruments

Summary

The goal of this lab was to use several pieces of electronic test equipment to understand how to use them in future lab assignments. The equipment used was a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a direct current power supply. These were the items used to measure several types of elements of electrical signals. This lab also required learning about how to begin using GitHub, which is how lab reports will be submitted. 
The first piece of equipment used was the Fluke DMM. This was used to measure the resistance, and then compare that value to the expected value of the resistor. A similar procedure was followed to measure the capacitance of four capacitors. Next, the DC power supply was used to set three voltage values. These were measured with the DMM and a tolerance value was calculated. Next, the function generator was used to measure the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave produced.

For the measured values of the resistors, all of the resistors were within the tolerance range except for R3.

The instruments did agree with the expected value. The polarity will have a slight afffect on the measurements, but it will not be significant.

For the most part, the instruments did agree with one another. There were slight differences that are likely due to resistance in the wires.

The values from the different methods were not siginificantly different from one another for both frequency and amplitude. Changing the frequency and amplitude generated a change in the sinusoidal wave on the oscilloscope.
