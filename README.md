Summary

The goal of this lab was to use several pieces of electronic test equipment to understand how to use them in future lab assignments. The equipment used was a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and a direct current power supply. These were the items used to measure several types of elements of electrical signals. This lab also required learning about how to begin using GitHub, which is how lab reports will be submitted. 
The first piece of equipment used was the Fluke DMM. This was used to measure the resistance, and then compare that value to the expected value of the resistor. A similar procedure was followed to measure the capacitance of four capacitors. Next, the DC power supply was used to set three voltage values. These were measured with the DMM and a tolerance value was calculated. Next, the function generator was used to measure the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave produced.
